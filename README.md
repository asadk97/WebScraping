# WebScraping


A simple web scraping code that takes the data from a website of your choice that you enter in yourself. 
Personally I would recommend to copy and paste the website directly.

It works by the url entered going through the code and then the code would read through the html coding of the page and then take out any unnecessary data such as tags. 


To run the web scraping simply enter:

$python main.py --site 

and then add in the site that you would like to scrape after '--site '
