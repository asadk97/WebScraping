# WebScraping with Unit Test and command lines



### Description

A simple web scraping code that takes the data from a website of your choice that you enter in yourself, personally I would recommend to copy and paste the website directly into the terminal. It works by the url entered going through the code and then the code would read through the html coding of the page and then take out any unnecessary data such as tags. 



### Tutorial and Instructions

To run the web scraping simply enter in the terminal:

1. `$python main_task.py --site` 
2. Add in the site that you would like to scrape after `$python main_task.py --site "https://www.google.co.uk`



This branch also contains both the command lines and the unit tests to ensure that the user is able to input the correct site formats
